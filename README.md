# The Faulting Problem
### by Robert Valentine (A.K.A. Robert Chubb)

## Conjecture:
For any software system $S$, there exists a set $B$ of bugs and vulnerabilities such that $B$ is non-empty and $S$ cannot function without at least one element from $B$ present.


Assume there exists a software system $S$ that is completely bug-free and devoid of vulnerabilities.

Let $B$ represent the set of all possible bugs and vulnerabilities that could potentially exist in $S$.

Let $S$ be represented by a function $F$ that maps inputs $I$ to outputs $O$. Mathematically, $F:I→O$.

If $S$ is truly bug-free and devoid of vulnerabilities, then $B$ is an empty set, implying $B=\\{\\}$.

However, by the nature of software complexity and the sheer number of possible inputs and configurations, the space of $I$ is often infinite or exceedingly large.

According to the Halting Problem, there exist inputs $I$ for which it is undecidable whether $F$ will halt or not.

This implies that for some inputs, $F$ may enter into an unexpected or unintended state, even in a bug-free system.

Therefore, there must exist at least one input $I$ for which $F$ exhibits unexpected behavior, thereby contradicting the assumption that $S$ is completely bug-free.

Hence, $S$ cannot be completely bug-free, and there must exist at least one bug or vulnerability present in $S$ for it to be functional across all possible inputs.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as: $∀S, ∃B$ such that $B=\\{\\}$ and $S$ cannot function without $B$.

## Coq Implementation:
```coq
Parameter Software : Type. (* Define the type of software *)

Parameter decides_bug : Software -> Prop. (* Predicate for deciding if software has bugs *)

Definition bug_existence_problem : Prop :=
  (exists s, decides_bug s) -> False.

Definition bug_existence_problem' : Prop :=
  forall s, decides_bug s -> False.

Theorem statements_equivalent_bug_existence :
  bug_existence_problem <-> bug_existence_problem'.
Proof.
  unfold bug_existence_problem, bug_existence_problem'; split; intros.
  - exact (H (ex_intro decides_bug s H0)).
  - destruct H0.
    exact (H x H0).
Qed.
```

## Coq Implementation Explained
$Software$ represents the type of software. $decides\\_bug$ is a predicate that determines whether a given software has bugs. $bug\\_existence\\_problem$ is a proposition stating that it's impossible to decide whether any software has bugs. $bug\\_existence\\_problem'$ is an equivalent formulation of $bug\\_existence\\_problem$ using universal quantification. The $statements\\_equivalent\\_bug\\_existence$ theorem proves the equivalence between the two formulations of the bug existence problem. Diagonalization arugment is used in a manner of speaking. While the Coq implementation does not involve constructing a diagonal argument explicitly, the concept of undecidability and the impossibility of resolving certain questions within formal systems are fundamental to both the Diagonalization argument and the propositions presented.

## Conclusion:
This conjecture aligns with the essence of the Halting Problem, indicating that it is impossible to guarantee the absence of bugs and vulnerabilities in any non-trivial software system.
